This is a fork of BawAppie's A-Font tweak. It removes the checks for if "/var/jb/.installed_dopamine" exists and instead points these checks to "/var/jb" allowing it to be installed without dkpg errors in Sileo/Zebra and allow it's preferences to work on non Dopamine rootless jailbreaks.

Personally tested on my iPhone 12 pro max running iOS 15.0.2 and Xina 2.1.5.2
